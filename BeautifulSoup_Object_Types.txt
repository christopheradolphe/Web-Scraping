#BeautifulSoup Objects

BeautifulSoup objects:
Instances seen by instantiating bs = BeautifulSoup(html.read(), 'html.parser')

Tag objects:
Retrieved in lists, or retrieved individually by calling find and find_all on a BeautifulSoup object, or drilling down, as follows:
bs.div.h1


NavigableString objects:
Used to represent text within tags, rather than the tags themselves (some functions operate on and produce NavigableStrings, rather than tag objects).

Comment object
Used to find HTML comments in comment tags, <!--like this one-- >.
